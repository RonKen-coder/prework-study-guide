# Preliminary Study Manual Website

## Description

The impetus for this project was rooted in a desire to deepen my understanding of software development and enhance my proficiency in coding and web design. I have long been intrigued by the potential of coding to address complex problems and automate tasks within professional settings. Engaging in this project afforded me the opportunity to explore these aspects firsthand, enabling me to develop critical problem-solving skills and effectively debug issues as they arose. This experience is directly aligned with my aspiration to acquire expertise in software development and coding. Throughout the process, I successfully constructed a web page while concurrently learning various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among others. The early identification and resolution of bugs in the project were particularly rewarding, as the process of diagnosing and rectifying errors provided significant personal and professional fulfillment.
